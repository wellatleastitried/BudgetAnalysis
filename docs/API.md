## Data Models

### Budget Calculation Model

The core calculation logic considers:

1. **Income**: Monthly take-home pay calculated from pay frequency
2. **Expenses**: Fixed monthly expenses (housing, insurance, etc.)
3. **401(k) Contributions**: Employee and employer contributions
4. **Savings**: Liquid savings after expenses
5. **Projections**: 1, 2, and 10-year savings projections

### Savings Rate Calculation

```
Total Monthly Savings = Liquid Savings + Total 401(k) Contributions
Savings Rate = (Total Monthly Savings / Gross Monthly Income) Ã— 100
```

Where Gross Monthly Income includes employer 401(k) contributions.

## Usage Examples
